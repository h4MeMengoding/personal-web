I spent most of my time in 2019 at college, trying to finish all my university courses by the end of 7th semester so I can focus on Thesis / Final Project at the final semester (8th semester). Planning to graduate in 2020. So...not really much happened in this year, but I learned so much in terms of mobile application and web development.
