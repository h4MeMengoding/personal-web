Nathan is a very organized and intelligent engineer, always think more about optimization, and try to look from multiple point of views regarding a product. Over the course of his career in pinhome, he has standardized our workflow in Ares squad, made a lot of documentation to help other fellow engineers. He also discussed alot with the products to confirm and ensure there is no mistake when delivering a product. A good role model for any other engineers.
